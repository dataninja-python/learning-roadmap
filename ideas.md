# FOCUS

1. functional programming in rust
2. Rust for everything => Web apps | gaming | learning
3. Rust create a new knowledge-driven language => Haskel/Idris + Coq/Prolog (logical/mathematic programming) + Lisp/Clojure + Elm + Erlang + assembly + python + JS/TS + Fortran + Data Science + Machine Learning + AI
   * + Mathematic solvers + knowledge databases + ram databases + P2P + cryptography + encrypted vaults + 
   * ssd/hd + shared drives + DRY concepts + transpiling + JVM + 
   * package conversion (from any language you can transpile to) + Sqlite + OrientDB
   * myLangOS -> a language + OS + type 2 hypervisor + container microservices environment +
   * AI-swarmIntelligent-autonomous-selfEvolvingEntropicEcosystem-driven-design + 
   * PROBLEM: How to quickly build provably current, performant, safe, no-crash, self-refactoring ->
   * down to the FPGA (field programmable gate arrays)?
4. myLangOS => Lisp + emacs + nyxt browser + smalltalk/pharo + qemu/KVM => read-evaluate-print-loop (REPL) language written in myLang image based comtainer on VM 
   * Basically, a completely customizable OS like smalltalk that runs its own fully customizable IDE like emacs that looks more attractive than VSCode with more productivity tooling than vim + neovim + sublime text + VSCode + intellij combined (because myLang Colonies should learn to convert packages from each over time) -> don't over think it, simple scan each on a regular basis and integrate most popular features from each every OS, IDE, and programming language -> really good at reverse engineering (just like Colony = let them fight with themselves)
5. 100% DRY -> write in YOUR language -> use YOUR environment (myLangOS - wraps around chosen tool - like firejail - or you can use the myLangOS version (lots of dryFus cells use Data Science + Machine Learning + NLP + AI => write more performant, more usable, better UX/UI, non-plagiarized (code is different enough to pass automated online plagiarize tests => basically, use adversarial, genetic cell ecosystems to make increasingly better cell generations => beat plagiarizers and stay ahead of them), incredibly similar versions of most popular tools -> Kubernetes, Docker, Podman, qemu/KVM, linux kernel, every algorithm)) ->
